    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Adobong Pusit is a tasty squid dish cooked using the popular Filipino adobo method. 
        Squid is first boiled in soy sauce and vinegar then later sautéed in garlic, onions and tomatoes; 
        this brings in an awesome array of flavors that will surely activate your taste buds.</p>
    
    <p>Technically, any squid will do for this recipe. 
        However, small to medium sized squids are highly recommended because they are more flavorful compared to the large ones</p>
    
    <p>Since this is a squid dish, make sure that you don’t cook the squid longer than the indicated time to preserve the tender texture. 
        If in case the texture of the squid becomes rubbery due to over cooking, try cooking it some more. 
        You see – there are two ways to ensure that the squid that you are cooking is tender: 
        you can either cook it for a short time or add more cooking time as you usually do for pork.</p>
