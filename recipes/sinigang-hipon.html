    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sinigang na Hipon sa Sampaloc or Filipino Shrimp Soup in tamarind broth is a quick and easy soup dish that you can prepare for lunch or dinner.
         This dish is quite flexible with the vegetable ingredients because you can mix and match your preferred sinigang 
         veggies and you can also add some long green chili or finger pepper to make it bit spicy.</p>
    
    <p>TThere are many ways to cook Sinigang na Hipon; this recipe is just one of them.

        The good thing about this Sinigang na hipon version is its simplicity. 
        There are minimal veggies involved, but still the outcome was good and I really find it to be comforting.
