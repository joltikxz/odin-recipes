    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Tinola is a Filipino soup dish. It involves cooking chicken pieces in ginger broth. 
        It is a popular cold weather dish. I always feel warm and cozy every time I eat it. 
        This Filipino Chicken Soup is best enjoyed with fish sauce as dipping sauce, and a cup of warm white rice.</p>
    
    <p>Tinola is traditionally cooked with wedges of unripe papaya and malunggay leaves. 
        These components make it a good source of nutrients. The secret in making a good tinola is to simmer the chicken for longer periods of time. 
        his extracts the flavor from the chicken. It also makes the chicken tender in the process.</p>
